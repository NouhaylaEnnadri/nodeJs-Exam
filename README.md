## Features

- Implement a Node.js server for handling requests.
- Utilize Express.js for routing and middleware.
- Implement basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

## Project Structure

- **`server.js`**: The main entry point for the Node.js server.
- **`routes/`**: Contains route definitions and handlers.
- **`models/`**: Includes database models (if using a database).
- **`controllers/`**: Contains business logic and interaction with models.
- **`tests/`**: Folder for unit tests and test scripts.
- **`package.json`**: Contains project metadata and dependencies.

## Installation

To get started with the Node.js Exam Project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NouhaylaEnnadri/nodeJs-Exam.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd nodeJs-Exam
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Start the server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

5. **Run tests** (if applicable):
    ```bash
   nodemon app.js
    ```

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can:

- Access the application or API endpoints as defined in the routes.
- Test the functionality of CRUD operations .
- Use tools like Postman or cURL to interact with the API endpoints.
